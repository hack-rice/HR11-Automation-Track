# Hack Rice 11 Automation Track

## Track Description
Automation has existed for as long as we’ve been alive—from the invention of the water clock to machines assembling cars. It exists to increase efficiency while eliminating human error. Usually when we hear the word “automation” we think of robots in factories. But with the rise of digital technology, we’ve seen automation take different forms. We’ve seen digital automation in the form of job schedulers all the way to automated voice machines when you call technical support. It exists all around us, and its use only continues to grow.

Just as we have seen digital automation grow, we’ve seen its increasing use for malicious purposes. Telemarketers use programs that automatically call working telephone lines to try to sell products. However, this same technology is also used by telephone scammers who managed to scam [nearly 60 million americans](https://truecaller.blog/2021/06/28/us-spam-scam-report-21/) out of almost $30 billion dollars just last year alone.
